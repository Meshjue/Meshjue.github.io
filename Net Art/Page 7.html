<p>It's 7 o' clock and they've just arrived at their first club for an open mic. They walk in, sign up for a spot on the line up, and they wait until it's their turn.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they're lucky and they get one of the earlier spots and are able to perform at other clubs.</p>
<p>Othertimes, a comic may wait until 1 or 2 in the morning just to get 4-5 minutes of stage time.</p>
<p>Regardless, it all feels worth it once their on stage.</p>
