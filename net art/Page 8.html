<p>Like I said, it all feels worth it once their in control of that mic.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter how shitty the day job is. It doesn't matter how long the wait is.</p>
<p>All that matters is that time on stage.</p>
<p>It's not guarenteed that they will even do well. At best they will be mediocre, but more like they won't do very well and will bomb.</p>
<p>Which is expected. If they are at an open mic, they aren't fully versed in the art form and art still trying to figure it out.</p>
<p>But over time, hopefully, they will learn and get better.</p>
