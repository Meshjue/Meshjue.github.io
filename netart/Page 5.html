<p>After work, a comic will take some to write new material or build upon anything they have already performed.</p>
<p>Ideally, a comic will always make the effort to write new material, so they become better writers & performers over time.</p> 
<p>Writing for a comedian is crucial because those who do not put in the work to constantly develop their matieral grow as comedians,
will likely stagnate and not be offered as much stage time.</p>
<p>The comedian who works the hardest will likely reap the most rewards.</p>
